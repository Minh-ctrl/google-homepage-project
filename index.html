  <p>Aesop Rock is an incredibly verbose rapper who can weave and communicate deep and complex ideas in his lyrics. In my opinion, his albums should be ranked as follow: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. None shall pass </li>
    <li>2. Mystery Fish</li>
    <li>3. Skelethon</li>
    <li>4. Spirit World Field Guide</li>
    <li>5. Labor Days</li>
    <li>6. Float</li>
    <li>7. Whatever else he's dropped besides the above mentioned</li>
  </ul>
